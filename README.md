# 1. Image Filtering in the Spatial Domain

Examples:
1. noise.m - Add noise to the image
2. mean_filter.m - Mean filter in spatial domain
3. median_filter.m - Median filter in spatial domain
4. order_statistic_filtering.m - Order-statistic filtering in spatial domain
5. gaussian_filter.m - Gaussian filtering in spatial domain

# 2. Edge detection

Examples
1. first_order_edge_detection.m
2. second_odred_edge_detection.m
3. zero_crossing_edge_detector.m
4. edge_emphasise.m
